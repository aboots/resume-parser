# Automated Resume Parser
This project is an automated resume parser and analyzer, designed as a Python package. It can process multiple CVs, extract valuable information, and store the data in a CSV file for easy comparison and analysis. The application is particularly useful for Applicant Tracking Systems, enhancing their ability to review resumes. It utilizes rule-based methods such as regular expressions and custom datasets created from various sources. Currently, it supports Persian CVs with plans to extend functionality for English resumes.
