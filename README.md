# CV-Reader
An application (can be used as a python package) that can take some Cvs as input and extract valuable information from each of them and store them in a CSV output file. This project can help Applicant Tracking Systems to have a better view of resumes and it makes applicant comparison much easier. In this project, we use rule‐based methods such as regular expressions or datasets which we create after crawling various places. It works now for Persian CVs but we plan to extend it for English ones too.
